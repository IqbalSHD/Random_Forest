# Randoom Forest
 Heart Disease Prediction Using Random Forest

    This project was made for the Final Year Project(FYP) of the final semester.

    randomForest.py will call DecisioTree and file Train.py will call randomForest.
    Train.py will create train model and save it in folder model .

# GUI
Fill in 13 patient data and press the "Predict" button to get
the results of either "Heart Disease" or "NO Heart Disease"
    In folder model has extra trained ModelKNN and ModelSVC that will be used and call by gui.py.
    without it gui cannaot run prefetly.

        Coding to build and train KNN and SVC is not placed here because
        this github project focuses only on Random Forest.
